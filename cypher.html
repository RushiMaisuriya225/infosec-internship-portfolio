<h1>The Musical Cypher Project</h1>
<p>During my internship, I developed a custom encryption algorithm designed for secure, high-level executive communication. The goal was to create a unique method for the CEO to transmit messages exclusively to department heads (IT, Finance, Operations, HR) in a format that appears indistinguishable from random data—or in this case, music.</p>

<section class="card">
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The cypher transforms text into a musical sequence, adding layers of mathematical obfuscation that require specific "role" and "department" keys to decode. This ensures that a message intended for the CIO cannot be read by the CFO, even if they intercepted it.</p>

<h2>The Encryption Process</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Text to Number:</strong> The message is first converted from standard text alphabets into ASCII decimal codes.</li>
<li><strong>Role Multiplication:</strong> The decimal is multiplied by a secret Role Code unique to the specific recipient (e.g., the Chief Information Officer).</li>
<li><strong>Department Salting:</strong> A confidential Department Number is added to the result. This acts as a "salt," ensuring the math is specific to one division (like IT or Finance).</li>
<li><strong>Binary Conversion:</strong> The final calculated number is converted into binary code (0s and 1s).</li>
<li><strong>Musical Mapping:</strong> The binary code is mapped to piano keys. For example, a "0" might represent a white key and a "1" a black key, turning the confidential message into a playable melody.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Social Engineering Simulation: Phishing</h1>
<p>As part of my training in defensive security, I was tasked with creating a realistic phishing simulation to understand how attackers exploit human trust. I developed a high-fidelity clone of an official correspondence from the major e-commerce platform AliExpress.</p>

<h2>⚠ Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The phishing emails displayed on this page were created strictly for cybersecurity awareness training and defensive security education. They were never deployed in real-world attacks and are presented solely to demonstrate how social engineering techniques operate.</p>

<section class="card">
<h2>The Simulation Scenario</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Hook:</strong> The email subject line—"Suspicious Activity Detected – Order On Hold"—is designed to trigger immediate urgency and concern in the recipient.</li>
<li><strong>The Lure:</strong> The body copy informs the user that their recent order has been paused due to "unusual activity," a common tactic used to bypass a victim's logical analysis.</li>
<li><strong>The Trap:</strong> To "resolve" the issue, the user is instructed to click a verification link. While the email mimics the visual identity of AliExpress perfectly, the link directs the user to a malicious external site (www.maliciouslink.com) rather than the official domain.</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section class="card">
<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>This exercise demonstrates Brand Impersonation. By replicating the exact logo, fonts, and professional tone of a trusted company, attackers can trick even cautious users into revealing credentials or installing malware.</p>
